Is it \"Emissions to water\" / \"Water pollutants\" / \"Pollutants to water\"?\n  * If YES, proceed to Step 2\n  * If NO (e.g., \"Water discharge\", \"Water withdrawal\", \"Wastewater volume\"), return NULL immediately\n\n- Step 2: Look for a \"Total\" row in the table\n  * If found, extract ONLY that total value\n  * Do NOT sum other rows if total exists\n  * Example: If table has rows for \"Copper\", \"Zinc\", \"Lead\", and \"Total\", extract only the Total\n\n- Step 3: If NO \"Total\" row exists, check:\n  * Are all listed items water pollutants (COD, BOD, nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals)?\n  * Are they all for the SAME year and SAME scope (e.g., all for 2023, all for operations)?\n  * If YES to both: sum them\n  * If NO: return NULL\n\n- Step 4: Multiple years in table?\n  * Always select the most recent year\n  * Ensure all values summed come from the same year column\n\nSPECIAL CASES:\n- If value explicitly zero (\"0\", \"none\", \"no emissions\") in an emissions table: return 0\n- If text mentions \"emissions to water\" but provides only a percentage or intensity: return null\n- If range given (e.g., \"45-55 tonnes\"): use midpoint (50)\n- If table shows emissions in scaled units (\"in millions\", \"in thousands\"), apply scale correctly\n  * Example: \"BOD: 3,804\" in a table with header \"(in tonnes)\" → extract 3,804 as-is\n  * Example: \"BOD: 3.804\" in a table with header \"(in thousands)\" → extract 3.804 × 1,000 = 3,804\n\nRETURN RULES:\n- Return ONLY the numeric value (no units, no text, no currency symbols)\n- Use dot (.) as decimal separator\n- Remove thousand separators (e.g., \"1,232\" becomes \"1232\")\n- Return exactly one value OR null\n- If no emissions to water value (absolute mass in tonnes) can be identified after checking all priorities, return null\n\nText:\n{context}"
